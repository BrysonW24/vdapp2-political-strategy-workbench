### Parliamentarian Integration

The system automatically recognizes all current Australian parliamentarians:

**Auto-Updates:**
- Fetches all 150 MPs and 76 Senators from Parliament House website
- Caches for 7 days, auto-refreshes when expired
- Adds all surnames to political keyword filtering
- No manual maintenance required

**API Access:**
```bash
# Get all parliamentarians with details
GET /api/parliamentarians

# Force refresh from Parliament House
GET /api/parliamentarians?refresh=true

# Get just surnames for keyword matching
GET /api/parliamentarians?keywords_only=true
```

**How It Works:**
1. On first news fetch, system calls `getParliamentarianKeywords()`
2. If cache is empty or expired (>7 days), fetches from Parliament House
3. Parses HTML to extract names, parties, electorates, positions
4. Returns array of surnames (e.g., ["albanese", "dutton", "plibersek", ...])
5. Surnames are merged into political keyword array
6. Articles mentioning any parliamentarian are flagged as political

**Example Coverage:**
- Cabinet ministers: Automatically recognized ✅
- Backbench MPs: Now recognized ✅
- Independent MPs: Now recognized ✅
- All Senators: Now recognized ✅
